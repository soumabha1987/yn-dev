As used in this Agreement, the term "Site" includes all Services websites, pages that are associated with or within each website and all devices, applications or services that H2H operates or offers that link to this Agreement. By accepting electronically (for example, clicking “I Agree”), installing, accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, as they may be amended from time to time in the future (see “Modifications” below).

The term “you” or “your” refers to your usage as either a Visitor or a Consumer.  The term “user” refers to anybody using the Services, including, without limitation, Visitors, Consumers, Payment Processors, or Creditors. The term “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to H2H. If you wish to make use of the Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the registration process to become a registered Consumer.  The term “Creditor” shall mean any person or entity to which a debt or other obligation is owed including any agent of said Creditor assisting with collection of the debt.

All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to arbitrability, the scope or enforceability of this Agreement to Arbitrate, or the interpretation of Section 17(B)(1) ("Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief"), shall be for a court of competent jurisdiction to decide.</p>
